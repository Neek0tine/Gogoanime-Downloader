# Gogoanime Downloader

A program to simplify the process of batch downloading anime series. Started off because torrent downloading is slow and I'm too lazy to click the "Download" button on each episode.

Differs from my other downloader <a href="https://github.com/Neek0tine/AnimeKisa-Downloader"> Anime-Kisa downloader </a>, Gogoanime has simpler website and therefore the program does not need selenium webdriver and runs purely on requests. (tl;dr : Runs 2x faster than anime kisa downloader)

## Installation

No executables files has been made available, considering the issue about trojan false positives when packaging through Pyinstaller or Py2Exe. 
To run it, do the following:

1.  Create the python environtment
```
# using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or if you use conda
```
conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
```

2. Simply run the main python file, and interact from the command line. No arguments required
```
python main.py
```
